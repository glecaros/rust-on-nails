The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I've used [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) on several projects and before that [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). I've found Parcel to be easier to use and so that is the recommendation for Nails.

## Setting up a Volume

If you look at your `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` you'll see a line that is commented out.

```yml
#- node_modules:/workspace/crates/asset-pipeline/node_modules # Set target as a volume for performance. 
```

Comment that back in and rebuild your devcontainer. This will setup the node_modules folder as a volume and you will get way better performance during builds. This is due to the fact the node_modules folder has many files and docker tries to sync them with your main file system.

Also in your `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` uncomment the following line.

```Dockerfile
#RUN sudo mkdir -p /workspace/crates/asset-pipeline/node_modules && sudo chown -R $USERNAME:$USERNAME /workspace/crates/asset-pipeline
```

## .gitignore

We need the following `.gitignore` file.

```
dist
node_modules
.parcel-cache
```

## Installing Parcel

To install parcel

```sh
$ mdir crates/asset-pipeline
$ cd crates/asset-pipeline
$ npm install --save-dev parcel
```

Now create an `crates/asset-pipeline/index.ts`

```typescript
import './scss/index.scss'
```

And also `crates/asset-pipeline/scss/index.scss`

```typescript
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

Add a scripts section to your package.json

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel watch ./asset-pipeline/index.ts",
    "release": "parcel build ./asset-pipeline/index.ts"
  },
```

## npm run start

And now when you run `npm install & npm run start` parcel will generate your assets into the dist folder. We should also update our `./.gitignore` to exclude the generated files.

```
/target
.parcel-cache
/app/dist
node_modules
```

## Adding Images

Create an empty images folder in `crates/asset-pipeline/images` then your project should now look something like this.

```sh
.
├── .devcontainer/
│   └── ...
└── crates/
│         asset-pipeline/
│         ├── .gitignore
│         ├── images/
│         │   └── ...
│         ├── index.scss
│         ├── index.ts
│         └── node_modules/
│             └── ...
│         axum-server/
│         │  └── main.rs
│         └── Cargo.toml
│         db/
│         └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── Cargo.toml
└── Cargo.lock
```

## What we have

We now have a pipeline to compile Typescript and SCSS assets and a place to store images.
